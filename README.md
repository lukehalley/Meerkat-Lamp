My Year 2 - Semester 2 project in which I implemented movement-based sound into a moving lamp which mimicked the movement of a Meerkat. The sound was synthesised using Steve Duda's VST "Serum" with the DAW "Ableton Live 9".

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

* Baseboard - self-built using instructions provided by lecturer.
* C - to write the program which sent MIDI signals across a CAN network.
* Speakers - Provided source of audio.
* Serum (VST) -  Used to synthesise audio based on lamps movement
* Ableton Live 9 - Hosted the VST "Serum" and output audio.
